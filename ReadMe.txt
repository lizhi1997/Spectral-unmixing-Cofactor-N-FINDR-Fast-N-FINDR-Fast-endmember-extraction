This is a MATLAB implementation of fast endmember extraction.

The method is presented in the paper: Cofactor-Based Efficient Endmember Extraction for Green Algae Area Estimation.

Run: Demo_Cofactor.m

data:
M_img: multi-spectral data (Np*Nb); (After reshape)
PCA_img: data after dimension reduction by PCA;
Nx: the row of multi-spectral data; Nx: the column of multi-spectral data;  
Np£ºthe  total number of pixels in Multi-spectral data;Nb: the number of bands;
